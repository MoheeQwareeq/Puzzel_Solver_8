# Puzzel_Solver_8

This project is designed to solve the 8-puzzle and provide users with a clear solution, guiding them through each step to reach the final solved state.

The 8-puzzle is a square board with 9 positions, filled by 8 numbered tiles and one gap. At any point, a tile adjacent to the gap can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap position. In other words, the gap can be swapped with an adjacent (horizontally and vertically) tile. The objective in the game is to begin with an arbitrary configuration of tiles and move them to get the numbered tiles arranged in ascending order either running around the perimeter of the board or ordered from left to right, with 1 in the top left-hand position.

Features:

User Interface: The program provides a user-friendly GUI for inputting the initial and goal states of the puzzle.

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose between two search algorithms:
A* Algorithm and Greedy Algorithm.

Heuristic Selection: Users can choose from two different heuristics for estimating the cost of reaching the goal state:
Manhattan Distance and Misplaced Tiles.


Solution Path Display: The program displays the tested path and the solution path to help users visualize the solving process.
